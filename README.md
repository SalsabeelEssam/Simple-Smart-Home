Using AVR Microcontroller

Using Atmega32 (2 ECU'S), to transfer data between them we use UART, It takes a password from the
user and allows him to enter the apartment, after he enters, he will see temperature degree and light
intensity on the screen and if the temp. Was higher than 40 it will show a warning and a buzzer will
be activated, but if he entered a wrong password 3 times in a row the system will shut down forever
